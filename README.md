# Week 5 Assignment Python

## Overview
This repository contains two Python assignments focusing on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts:  
- Classes and Objects  
- Inheritance  
- Encapsulation  
- Polymorphism  

These assignments are part of a learning exercise to understand and apply Python OOP principles in practical examples.

## Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class üèóÔ∏è
**Description:**  
Create a class representing a real-world object (e.g., Smartphone) with attributes and methods.  
- Includes **constructors** to initialize objects with unique values.  
- Demonstrates **encapsulation** using private attributes.  
- Explores **inheritance** by creating a subclass.

**Files:**  
- `Assignment1_Smartphone.py`

**Key Features:**  
- `Smartphone` class with attributes: brand, model, and private storage.  
- `GamingPhone` subclass inherits from `Smartphone`.  
- Methods to make calls and play games.

## Assignment 2: Polymorphism Challenge üé≠
**Description:**  
Create classes representing different entities (e.g., vehicles or animals) that share the same method name but implement it differently.  

**Files:**  
- `Assignment2_Polymorphism.py`

**Key Features:**  
- Classes: `Car`, `Plane`, `Boat`.  
- Each class defines a `move()` method differently.  
- Demonstrates **polymorphism** by using the same interface for different behaviors.
